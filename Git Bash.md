## Completely Remove a Git Submodule

1. Delete section from `.gitmodules`: 3 lines, starting with

    `[submodule "MODULE"]`

2. Stage `.gitmodules`: `git add .gitmodules`
3. Delete section from `.git/config`: 2 lines, starting with

    `[submodule "MODULE"]`

4. `git rm --cached path/to/submodule`
5. `rm -rf .git/modules/MODULE`
6. `git commit -m 'Removed module MODULE'`
7. `rm -rf path/to/submodule` (removes now untracked submodule files)

## Extract a Subproject w/ Git Subtree

You have a project `app` where one of the modules, `widget`, would better be kept in a separate Git repository. We'll assume `widget` now resides in a directory immediately under the project root `~/projects/app/widget/`. The `app` project is on Github, at `git@github.com:user/app.git`.

The goal is to have widget as a separate project `~/projects/widget/`, with its own Github repository `git@github.com:user/widget.git`. We'll assume this repository has been created and is still empty.

1. Go to project root:

        $ cd ~/projects/app/

2. Create a branch that contains only commits for files in `widget`:

        $ git subtree split --prefix=widget/ --branch=subtree/widget

3. Push this new branch to its own repository:

        $ git push git@github.com:user/widget.git subtree/widget:master

4. Create `widget` project directory:

        $ mkdir ~/projects/widget/; cd ~/projects/widget/

5. Pull the `widget` project from Github into its own directory:

        $ git clone git@github.com:user/widget.git

6. Maybe do some more development, and release the first version:

        $ git tag -a -m 'First stable release' v1.0.0
        $ git push --tags

At this time, you have two separate repositories. However, `app/widget/` is still part of the original repository. However, now it should be maintained in its own repository, and changes should be pulled into `app` from `widget`:

1. Remove the `widget` directory from the `app project`:

        $ cd ~/projects/app/
        $ git rm -rf widget/
        $ rm -rf widget/  # delete ignored files that were left behind

2. Fetch the `widget` release from Github (`--squash` "summarizes" all changes as single commit):

        $ git subtree add --prefix=widget/ --squash github.com:user/widget.git tags/v1.0.0
